# Various userscripts to make YouTube better.


## sort-channel-search-results.js
- For sorting the results of doing a search in user's channel
- Sort buttons are in a fly-out / slide-out panel on the right (near the channel's search facility)
- Manually trigger the sorting - by newest or oldest
- Will not automatically update the sorting as you scroll down - you need to click on the sort button(s) again.
 
 
## sort-playlists.js
- Sort your playlists in alphabetical order in YouTube.
- Adds Top / Down buttons for scrolling through playlists.
 
 
Requires a script manager to run the scripts.

NB: Unless broken, I will not add any features.
