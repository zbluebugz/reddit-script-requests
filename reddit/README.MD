## Reddit - change reddit's image sources from preview.redd.it to i.reddit.com

Reddit has been wrapping hosted reddit images with banners, etc and making it difficult to view the image by itself. 

The script "swap-img-sources.js" attempts to resolve this by changing the image's source from preview.redd.it to i.reddit.com.

Alternative method for removing banners around images, is to use [requestly addon/extension](https://github.com/requestly/requestly) and importing a rule ("requestly-reddit-image-fix.json") that overrides reddit's code for viewing images with banners, etc.
