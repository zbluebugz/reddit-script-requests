# Various userscript for Instagram

*** Use as is - no support provided ***

## Instagram-Clean-my-feed.user.js
This userscript does the following:
- Detects Sponsored/Suggested/Paid partnership posts and zap their contents.
  - Does not collapse articles - it hides the content.
  - This fixes the irritating scrolling issue.
  - Cannot delete the article(s) as instagram will throw an error and you have to reload the page.
  - Reduces the height by about 22.5% (any more could cause instagram to throw a wobbly or two).
- Enables video controls to be available
- Add 2 x menu options (in left-side bar)
  - Following
  - Favourites


## Instagram-Unmute-Videos.user.js
This userscript tries to unmute videos on Play video event.
- fixes issues *I* have with IG always muting the video after I unmute and press play.
